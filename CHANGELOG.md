- Breaking change: Routes for GitHub workflows badge have changed. See https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/8671 for more details
- Behaviour change: In this release we fixed a long standing bug. GitHub badges were previously not reading the base URL from the `config.service.baseUri`. This release fixes that bug, bringing the code into line with the documented behaviour. This should not cause a behaviour change for most users, but users who had previously set a value in `config.service.baseUri` which was previously ignored could see this now have an effect. Users who configure their instance using env vars rather than yaml should see no change.
